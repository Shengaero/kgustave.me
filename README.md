# kgustave.me

Dear reader,

This is my website's official source code.

This is public only as a resource to anyone looking to create a website
using the following:

- `node.js` with minimal commonjs (used only for pure-script and other specific files).
- `reactjs` using `react-dom`, `react-router`, and other popular react libraries.
- `typescript`, notably typescript in a `create-react-app` project.
- `sass`/`scss` along with various `bootstrap` resources.

This website is hosted via gh-pages at https://shengaero.github.io/,
or https://kgustave.me/

Sincerely,<br>
Kaidan Gustave
